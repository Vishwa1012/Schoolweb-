    <p>The MML Chaudhary Charitable and Educational Trust’s commitment to education in Vadodara began way back in 1990, with the establishment of the St. Kabir School, Vadodara (GSEB). Since its inception in 1990, St. Kabir (GSEB) has grown into a huge umbrella of education, under which over 1800 students – garner learning skills and content, know about the world, engage in edutainment activities, have fun… as well as build crucial life skills and a strong character.A new school under the Trust – the St. Kabir Indian International School, was established in 2011. The school is an independent, English-medium, co-educational school, affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education till the Senior Secondary School Examination level, with Science, Commerce & Arts Streams. The school is a full-fledged CBSE school, with Kabirites ready to set forth into the global arena for higher learning and career building.
Across all our units, we aim to provide a caring, happy, stimulating and inspiring environment in which all children feel safe and secure; where children are encouraged and motivated to work to the best of their ability to achieve the highest standards. We aim to do this by keeping our programmes child-centric, in a facilitator mode of learning, holistic and open to individualised development of the cognitive, social, emotional, physical, societal and spiritual domains.
Vadodara is a booming city in India and people from all over India migrate to this cultural capital of Gujarat. The city is an educational hub.
</p>

<p>However, It is believed that the education available in the current schools in Vadodara city, colleges and universities is a ‘job-oriented education’. This does not develop a high state of awareness and a sense to live life to the full potential. Present education is neither life-oriented nor enlightenment-oriented. It does not teach the students to spontaneously think and act according to the laws of nature.
Which is why we encourage our students to take part in various extracurriculars where they have to use their creativity, such as best out of waste ideas and competitions.
</p>

<p>The highest education goal of every nation is to create ideal citizens capable of fulfilling their goals while upholding the interests of others and the progress of the society. For this goal to become a reality, education must be imparted ethically.
St. Kabir Indian International School, listed among the top 10 CBSE schools in Vadodara is an abode where the children can enjoy the facets of life and the rhythm of living.

Through our activities, we aim at inspiring our children to develop constructive thinking to build a good personality. The sincerity and dedication of the staff, the unquestioned obedience of the pupils and the school administration’s guidance helps us to live the mission-vision-goals of the school thereby emerging as one of the best English Medium schools in Baroda(Vadodara).
St. Kabir Indian International School has excellent infrastructural facilities with well-equipped and well-maintained math and science laboratories.
